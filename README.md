# Crime-Analysis-and-Safety-Recommendations-For-Nigeria
This report analyzes crime data across 37 Nigerian states, identifying safer locations and high-crime areas. Key concerns include murder, rape, assault, and suicide, with targeted recommendations for law enforcement. Strengthening security, crime-specific task forces, and mental health support can enhance public safety nationwide.

# Problem Statement
Crime rates in Nigeria vary significantly across states. High incidences of violent crimes such as murder, rape, assault, and suicide pose serious threats to public safety in some states. Despite these challenges, resource allocation for crime prevention remains uneven, leading to gaps in law enforcement and public security measures. There is an urgent need for data-driven strategies to enhance policing efforts, deploy specialized task forces in high-risk areas to reduce crime and improve overall safety.

# Understanding the Data
Raw crime data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers that can impact analysis accuracy. To address this, I identified key metrics such as total crime, crime categories, average crime rate, and their distribution across states. Additionally, I categorized states into regions to analyze crime patterns at a regional level. 

# Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, correcting errors, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates to ensure data integrity. 
To enhance analysis, I also created an interactive dashboard, enabling head-to-head state comparisons for deeper insights. By thoroughly cleaning and structuring the data, I improved the reliability of insights, allowing for accurate crime trend analysis and informed decision-making for law enforcement and policymakers.

# Dashboard Creation in Power BI for Crime Analysis
I developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, enabling efficient data visualization and state-to-state comparisons. The process involved the following steps:  

1. Data Import & Cleaning – I imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI, ensuring all fields were properly structured for analysis. This included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats.  

2. Data Modeling – I created relationships between datasets, categorizing crime by type, state, and region. I also calculated key metrics such as total crime, average crime rate per state, and regional crime distributions to allow deeper insights.  

3. Interactive Visuals & Analysis – Using Power BI’s visualization tools, I designed:  
   - Crime Distribution Tables – Providing a detailed breakdown of crime by type and location.  
   - Regional Crime Heatmaps – Highlighting crime intensity across different parts of the country.  
   - State-to-State Comparison Charts – Allowing users to compare crime rates, murder cases, assaults, and other crimes between two or more states.  

5. User-Friendly Filters & Drill-Throughs – I added interactive filters, allowing users to drill down into specific states, regions, or crime categories, making the dashboard dynamic and tailored to specific analytical needs.  

The dashboard provides a comprehensive, data-driven approach to crime analysis, helping law enforcement and policymakers make informed decisions on resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.

# Executive Summary

Based on the provided crime data across 37 states in Nigeria, there are significant variations in crime rates, highlighting specific states as more dangerous or safer than others.

# Safest States for Living and Raising a Family

1. Kebbi State emerges as the safest state, having the lowest Total Crime (176) and Average Crime (12.57).

2. Osun State also shows a relatively low crime rate, particularly in violent crimes like Murder (25 cases, the lowest among states).

3. Anambra State recorded zero cases of rape, indicating a safer environment in this regard.

These states has shown lower crime rates across multiple categories and thus would be more favorable for raising a family.

# States with High Crime Rates and Areas Requiring Urgent Attention

1. Lagos State has the highest crime statistics across multiple categories, including:
a) Total Crime (37,852 cases)
b) Total Crime on People (18,926 cases, accounting for 35.30%)
c) Total Rape (441 cases, highest nationwide)
d) Total Murder (216 cases)

   Given its large population and economic significance, Lagos requires urgent crime reduction measures.

2. Edo State has the highest Attempted Murder (98 cases, accounting for 12.71%), indicating the need for increased security intervention in homicide prevention.

3. Abia State recorded the highest number of Assault cases (8,945, accounting for 37.24%), suggesting a high prevalence of violent altercations.

4. Rivers State leads in Suicide cases (105, accounting for 31.63%), pointing to a critical need for mental health interventions.

# Recommendations for Authorities

1.	Increase Manpower in Lagos – With the highest crime rates across multiple categories (rape, murder, assault, and total crime), Lagos should receive significant law enforcement reinforcements and improved community policing strategies.
   
2.	Focus on Homicide Prevention in Edo and Ebonyi – These states have high Attempted Murder and Murder rates. Targeted security patrols and forensic investigations can help mitigate these crimes.

3.	Address Gender-Based Violence in Kano and FCT-Abuja – After Lagos, these states recorded high rape cases, necessitating specialized gender crime units.

4.	Combat Rising Suicide Rates in Rivers, Borno, and Lagos – Mental health services and suicide prevention programs should be prioritized in these states.

5.	Control Violent Assault in Abia and Delta – Focused conflict resolution programs, better law enforcement visibility, and crime deterrence policies are required.
   
By deploying targeted law enforcement and social intervention measures, authorities can significantly enhance public safety and reduce crime in the most affected areas.
